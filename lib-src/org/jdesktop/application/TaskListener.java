 * Listener used for observing {@code Task} execution.

 * useful for monitoring the the intermediate results
 * {@link Task#publish published} by a Task in situations
 * where it's not practical to override the Task's
 * {@link Task#process process} method.  Note that if
 * what you really want to do is monitor a Task's state
 * and progress, a PropertyChangeListener is probably more
 * appropriate.
 * <p/>
 * The Task class runs all TaskListener methods on the event dispatching
 * thread and the source of all TaskEvents is the Task object.
