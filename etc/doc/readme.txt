III.   How to run FreeRapid Downloader
=======================================

Installation
------------
Unzip files to any of your directory, but beware special characters (like '+' or '!') on the path.
If you make an upgrade to higher version, you can delete previous folder. All user
settings are preserved. All user settings are saved in home directories:
MS Windows: c:\Documents and Settings\YOUR_USER_NAME\application data\VitySoft\FRD
            
Linux: ~/.FRD

DO NOT copy new version over older one.


How to get the latest Sun Java on Linux (Ubuntu)?

Run these commands:
- apt-get update
- apt-get install sun-java6-jre
- update-java-alternatives -l
- update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun

Launching
-----------
Windows
 Simply launch frd.exe or double click on frd.jar


Linux
 Run command ./frd.sh
 (as first put correct executable rights on this file )


All platforms
 Run command java -jar frd.jar


additional parameters for launching are:

java -jar frd.jar [-h -v -d -r -D<property>=<value> -m -p]

options
  -h (--help,-?)      print this message
  -v (--version)      print the version information and exit
  -d (--debug)        print debugging information
  -r (--reset)        reset user properties to default values  
  -m (--minim)        minimize main window on start  
  -Dproperty=value    Passes properties and values to the application (mostly for debug or testing purposes)
  -p (--portable)     configuration files will be stored in the 'config'
                      folder, all file paths will be saved relatively to FRD
                      folder (if possible) - useful for USB FLASH drives

If value of option -D is set 'default' (without ') default value will be used.

  Windows OS: frd.exe --debug
  Linux/MacOS: java -jar frd.jar --debug

IV.    Known bugs and Limitations
=======================================
- Application will not start if it's placed on the path with special characters like '+' or '%'
  - X please move application to another location without such characters
- ESET "Smart" Antivirus on Windows OS blocks FRD to start
  - X make correct settings of your antivirus program or run FRD this way: frd.exe -Doneinstance=false
- Always close FRD properly otherwise you can loose your file list (eg. Windows shutdown with force option...)          
- Selection from "top to bottom" in the main table during dragging while downloading partly disappears :-(
    X select table rows by ctrl+mouse click or select items from bottom to top
- Substance look and feel throws org.jvnet.substance.api.UiThreadingViolationException:
                                                     Component creation must be done on Event Dispatch Thread
    X ignore this exception in the app.log
- java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError exception
    X You are using old Java version, you should use Sun Java version 6 or newer
- IllegalArgumentException: 53687091 incompatible with Text-specific LCD contrast key
    X Fix your registry settings, please see forum thread (http://wordrider.net/forum/read.php?7,713,713#msg-713)
- DirectoryChooser throws java.lang.InternalError or freezes on Win Vista (64bit)
    X ignore this exception in the app.log

    X ignore this exception in the app.log
- java.lang.ClassCastException: java.awt.TrayIcon cannot be cast to java.awt.Component
    X ignore this exception in the app.log    
- Linux users reported not showing icon in tray on Linux
    X the only one known solution for this problem could be an upgrade JRE to version 1.6.0_10-rc or higher
- limitation: version 0.7x is not usable once you are using version 0.8 or newer (the only possible solution is to remove configuration files)

IV.    Troubleshooting
=======================================
1. Check section IV - for already known bugs and limitations first
2. Have you tried to application turn off and on again? :-)
3. Check homepage http://wordrider.net/freerapid and/or issue tracker at http://bugtracker.wordrider.net/
   for possible new known bug
4. You can try to delete configuration files (its location is described in section VI - Installation )  
5. Run application in debug mode:
   Windows OS: frd.exe --debug
   Linux/MacOS: java -jar frd.jar --debug
6. Report problem with app.log as described in section VI


VI.    Bug report
=======================================
If you see a bug, please do not assume that i know about it. Let me know as soon as possible so that i can fix it before
the next release. Since my resources are limited, i can not backport bug fixes to earlier releases.
To report a bug, you can use the issue tracker (preferred), project forums or my personal e-mail.

Please report your JRE and OS version and attach file app.log (which is located in FreeRapid's folder).
It can help us to recognize a problem. You can also help us if you run application with --debug parameter.
We ignore simple reports like "I cannot run FRD. What should I do?". Describe your situation and application behaviour.

Q: Why did you create another "RapidShare Downloader"?
