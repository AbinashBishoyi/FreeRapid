/**
 * The base class for Swing applications.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * This class defines a simple lifecyle for Swing applications: {@code
 * initialize}, {@code startup}, {@code ready}, and {@code shutdown}.
 * The {@code Application's} {@code startup} method is responsible for
 * creating the initial GUI and making it visible, and the {@code
 * shutdown} method for hiding the GUI and performing any other
 * cleanup actions before the application exits.  The {@code initialize}
 * method can be used configure system properties that must be set
 * before the GUI is constructed and the {@code ready}
 * method is for applications that want to do a little bit of extra
 * work once the GUI is "ready" to use.  Concrete subclasses must
 * override the {@code startup} method.
 * <p/>
 * Applications are started with the static {@code launch} method.
 * Applications use the {@code ApplicationContext} {@link
 * Application#getContext singleton} to find resources,
 * actions, local storage, and so on.
 * <p/>
 * All {@code Application} subclasses must override {@code startup}
 * and they should call {@link #exit} (which
 * calls {@code shutdown}) to exit.
 * Here's an example of a complete "Hello World" Application:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyApplication extends Application {
 *     JFrame mainFrame = null;
 *     &#064;Override protected void startup() {
 *         mainFrame = new JFrame("Hello World");
 *         mainFrame.add(new JLabel("Hello World"));
 *         mainFrame.addWindowListener(new MainFrameListener());
 *         mainFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE);
 *         mainFrame.pack();
 *         mainFrame.setVisible(true);
 *     }
 *     &#064;Override protected void shutdown() {
 *         mainFrame.setVisible(false);
 *     }
 *     private class MainFrameListener extends WindowAdapter {
 *         public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
 *            exit();
 *         }
 *     }
 *     public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         Application.launch(MyApplication.class, args);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The {@code mainFrame's} {@code defaultCloseOperation} is set
 * to {@code DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE} because we're handling attempts
 * to close the window by calling
 * {@code ApplicationContext} {@link #exit}.
 * <p/>
 * Simple single frame applications like the example can be defined
 * more easily with the {@link SingleFrameApplication
 * SingleFrameApplication} {@code Application} subclass.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * All of the Application's methods are called (must be called) on
 * the EDT.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * All but the most trivial applications should define a ResourceBundle
 * in the resources subpackage with the same name as the application class (like {@code
 * resources/MyApplication.properties}).  This ResourceBundle contains
 * resources shared by the entire application and should begin with the
 * following the standard Application resources:
 * <pre>
 * Application.name = A short name, typically just a few words
 * Application.id = Suitable for Application specific identifiers, like file names
 * Application.title = A title suitable for dialogs and frames
 * Application.version = A version string that can be incorporated into messages
 * Application.vendor = A proper name, like Sun Microsystems, Inc.
 * Application.vendorId = suitable for Application-vendor specific identifiers, like file names.
 * Application.homepage = A URL like http://www.javadesktop.org
 * Application.description =  One brief sentence
 * Application.lookAndFeel = either system, default, or a LookAndFeel class name
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The {@code Application.lookAndFeel} resource is used to initialize the
 * {@code UIManager lookAndFeel} as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code system} - the system (native) look and feel</li>
 * <li>{@code default} - use the JVM default, typically the cross platform look and feel</li>
 * <li>a LookAndFeel class name - use the specified class
 * </ul>

     * <p/>
     * Typically this method is only called after an Application has
     * been launched however in some situations, like tests, it's useful to be
     * able to get an {@code Application} object without actually
     * launching.  The <i>placeholder</i> Application object provides
     * access to an {@code ApplicationContext} singleton and has
     * the same semantics as launching an Application defined like this:
     * <pre>
     * public class PlaceholderApplication extends Application {
     *     public void startup() { }
     * }
     * Application.launch(PlaceholderApplication.class);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @return the Application singleton or a placeholder
     * @see Application#launch
     * @see Application#getInstance(Class)
