/**
 * The standard base class to implement the <em>Presentation Model</em> pattern, that represents the state and behavior
 * of a presentation independently of the GUI components used in the interface. This <a
 * href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">pattern</a> is described in Martin Fowler's upcoming <a
 * href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/">addition</a> to his "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture". More
 * details around this implementation of the Presentation Model pattern and a 3-tier Swing client architecture with a
 * presentation model layer can be found in the <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/binding.pdf">JGoodies Binding
 * presentation</a>. This architecture is supported by the JGoodies Binding library. The PresentationModel pattern is
 * known to users of VisualWorks Smalltalk as <em>ApplicationModel</em>.<p>
 * <p/>
 * This class minimizes the effort required to bind, edit, buffer, and observe the bound properties of an exchangeable
 * bean. Therefore it provides five groups of features that are described below:<ol> <li>adapt bean properties,
 * <li>change the adapted bean, <li>buffer values, <li>observe the buffering state, and <li>track changes in adapted
 * bean properties. </ol><p>
 * <p/>
 * Typically this class will be extended to add custom models, Actions, presentation logic, model operations and other
 * higher-level behavior. However, in simple cases you can use this class as-is. Several methods are intended to be used
 * as-is and a typical subclass should not modify them. For example #isChanged, #isBuffering, #getBean, #setBean,
 * #getBeanChannel, #getModel, #getBufferedModel, #getTriggerChannel, #setTriggerChannel, #triggerCommit and
 * #triggerFlush.<p>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Adapting Bean Properties</strong><br> The method {@link #getModel(String)} vends ValueModels that adapt a
 * bound bean property of an exchangeable bean. These ValueModels will be requested from an underlying BeanAdapter. To
 * get such a model you specify the name of the bean property. All properties adapted must be read-write and must comply
 * with the Java Bean coding conventions. In case you need to adapt a read-only or write-only property, or if the bean
 * uses custom names for the reader and writer, use {@link #getModel(String,String,String)}. Also note that you must not
 * mix calls to these methods for the same property name. For details see the JavaDoc class comment in {@link
 * com.jgoodies.binding.beans.BeanAdapter}.<p>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Changing the Adapted Bean</strong><br> The adapted bean is not stored in this PresentationModel. Instead it
 * is held by a ValueModel, the <em>bean channel</em> - just as in the PropertyAdapter and BeanAdapter. This indirection
 * enables you to manage the adapted bean outside of this PresentationModel, and it enables you to share bean channels
 * between multiple PresentationModels, PropertyAdapters, and BeanAdapters. The bean channel is used by all adapting
 * models created by the factory methods <code>#getModel</code>. You can get and set the current bean by means of
 * <code>#getBean</code> and <code>#setBean</code>. Or you can set a new value to the bean channel.<p>
 * <p/>
 * PresentationModel fires three PropertyChangeEvents if the bean changes: <i>beforeBean</i>, <i>bean</i> and
 * <i>afterBean</i>. This is useful when sharing a bean channel and you must perform an operation before or after other
 * listeners handle a bean change. Since you cannot rely on the order listeners will be notified, only the
 * <i>beforeBean</i> and <i>afterBean</i> events are guaranteed to be fired before and after the bean change is fired.
 * Note that <code>#getBean()</code> returns the new bean before any of these three PropertyChangeEvents is fired.
 * Therefore listeners that handle these events must use the event's old and new value to determine the old and new
 * bean. The order of events fired during a bean change is:<ol> <li>the bean channel fires a <i>value</i> change,
 * <li>this model fires a <i>beforeBean</i> change, <li>this model fires the <i>bean</i> change, <li>this model fires an
 * <i>afterBean</i> change. </ol>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Buffering Values</strong><br> At the core of this feature are the methods {@link #getBufferedModel(String)}
 * that vend BufferedValueModels that wrap an adapted bean property. The buffer can be committed or flushed using
 * <code>#triggerCommit</code> and <code>#triggerFlush</code> respectively.<p>
 * <p/>
 * The trigger channel is provided as a bound Java bean property <em>triggerChannel</em> that must be a
 * non-<code>null</code> <code>ValueModel</code> with values of type <code>Boolean</code>. Attempts to read or write
 * other value types may be rejected with runtime exceptions. By default the trigger channel is initialized as an
 * instance of <code>Trigger</code>. As an alternative it can be set in the constructor.<p>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Observing the Buffering State</strong><br> This class also provides support for observing the buffering state
 * of the BufferedValueModels created with this model. The buffering state is useful for UI actions and operations that
 * are enabled or disabled if there are pending changes, for example on OK or APPLY button. API users can request the
 * buffering state via <code>#isBuffering</code> and can observe the bound property <em>buffering</em>.<p>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Tracking Changes in the Adapted Bean</strong><br> PresentationModel provides support for observing bean
 * property changes and it tracks all changes to report the overall changed state. The latter is useful to detect
 * whether the bean has changed at all, for example to mark the bean as dirty, so it will be updated in a database. API
 * users can request the changed state via <code>#isChanged</code> and can observe the bound property <em>changed</em>.
 * If you want to track changes of other ValueModels, bean properties, or of submodels, register them using
 * <code>#observeChanged</code>. To reset the changed state invoke <code>#resetChanged</code>. In case you track the
 * changed state of submodels you should override <code>#resetChanged</code> to reset the changed state in these
 * submodels.<p>
 * <p/>
 * The changed state changes once only (from false to true). If you need instant notifications about changes in the
 * properties of the target bean, you can register PropertyChangeListeners with this model. This is useful if you change
 * the bean and don't want to move your listeners from one bean to the other. And it's useful if you want to observe
 * multiple bean properties at the same time. These listeners are managed by the method set
 * <code>#addBeanPropertyChangeListener</code> and <code>#removeBeanPropertyChangeListener</code>. Listeners registered
 * via these methods will be removed from the old bean before the bean changes and will be re-added after the new bean
 * has been set. Therefore these listeners will be notified about changes only if the current bean changes a property.
 * They won't be notified if the bean changes - and in turn the property value. If you want to observes property changes
 * caused by bean changes too, register with the adapting ValueModel as returned by <code>#getModel(String)</code>.<p>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Instance Creation</strong><br> PresentationModel can be instantiated using four different constructors: you
 * can specify the target bean directly, or you can provide a <em>bean channel</em> to access the bean indirectly. In
 * the latter case you specify a <code>ValueModel</code> that holds the bean that in turn holds the adapted property. In
 * both cases the target bean is accessed indirectly through the bean channel. In both cases you can specify a custom
 * trigger channel, or you can use a default trigger channel.<p>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> This PresentationModel provides bound bean properties and you can register and unregister
 * PropertyChangeListers as usual using <code>#addPropertyChangeListener</code> and
 * <code>#removePropertyChangeListener</code>. Do not mix up the model listeners with the listeners registered with the
 * bean.<p>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong> PresentationModels register a PropertyChangeListener with the target bean. Hence, a bean
 * has a reference to all PresentationModels that hold it as target bean. To avoid memory leaks it is recommended to
 * remove this listener if the bean lives much longer than the PresentationModel, enabling the garbage collector to
 * remove the PresentationModel. Setting a PresentationModel's target bean to null removes this listener, which in turn
 * clears the reference from the bean to the PresentationModel. To do so, you can call <code>setBean(null)</code> or set
 * the bean channel's value to null. As an alternative you can use event listener lists in your beans that implement
 * references with <code>WeakReference</code>. Setting the bean to null has side effects, which is fine in most cases.
 * However, you can release all listeners by calling <code>#release</code>.<p>
 * <p/>
 * TODO: Further improve the class comment.<p>
 * <p/>
 * TODO: Consider adding a feature to ensure that update notifications are performed in the event dispatch thread. In
 * case the adapted bean is changed in a thread other than the event dispatch thread, such a feature would help
 * complying with Swing's single thread rule. The feature could be implemented by an extended PropertyChangeSupport.<p>
 * <p/>
 * TODO: I plan to improve the support for adapting beans that do not fire PropertyChangeEvents. This affects the
 * classes PropertyAdapter, BeanAdapter, and PresentationModel. Basically the PropertyAdapter and the BeanAdapter's
 * internal SimplePropertyAdapter's shall be able to optionally self-fire a PropertyChangeEvent in case the bean does
 * not. There are several downsides with self-firing events compared to bound bean properties. See <a
 * href="https://binding.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=49">Issue 49</a> for more information about the
 * downsides.<p>
 * <p/>
 * The observeChanges constructor parameter shall be replaced by a more fine-grained choice to not observe (former
 * observeChanges=false), to observe bound properties (former observeChanges=true), and a new setting for self-firing
 * PropertyChangeEvents if a value is set. The latter case may be further split up to specify how the self-fired
 * PropertyChangeEvent is created: <ol> <li>oldValue=null, newValue=null <li>oldValue=null, newValue=the value set
 * <li>oldValue=value read before the set, newValue=the value set <li>oldValue=value read before the set, newValue=value
 * read after the set </ol>
